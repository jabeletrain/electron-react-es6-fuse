# electron-fuse-babel

 Made with â™¥ by Martin!

**Clone and run for minimum config.**

This is a minimal Electron boilerplate to bundle your code via [fuse-box](http://fuse-box.org/). It uses [`gulp`](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp) to check for changes in your `src` folder and live-reloads it with [`electron-connect`](https://github.com/Quramy/electron-connect).
The babel preset is `es2015` but you can go ahead and use any you want like `latest`.

Hope this boilerplate helps!



## To Use

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/martinjackson/electron-fuse-babel
# Go into the repository
cd <your project name>
# Install dependencies
yarn
# Run the app
yarn start
```

Check the `gulpfile` for bundling and live-reloading.
Check `main.js` on function `createWindow()` for `electron-connect`'s client
